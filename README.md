# CS:PC (Counter-Strike: Prefire Creator)
A tool for CS:GO to create custom prefires on any map.

## Some info
Maybe I will code an installer, because it is complicated to download and setup everything.

## Guide
### How to load prefires?
Prefires are saved in .cfg (config) files. They contain commands like teleporting every bot, setting up things like ffa (free for all), give weapons, unlimited ammo etc.
You can either create your own prefires or download prefires made by other people (check the "prefire" folder to download prefires I already made).

#### Where do I put the config file?
1. Go into your CS:GO directory
2. Go into the folder csgo > cfg
3. Drag and drop your config file (you can also create folders to organize your prefires)

#### **How do I install the setup config?**
1. Download the "setup.cfg" file from the "prefire" folder in this repository
2. Drag and drop it into your csgo config folder

#### **How do I load the prefire?**
1. Start an offline round
2. Open the console (usually with the "~" key)
3. Type in "exec setup" to setup everything
4. Type in "exec \<prefire>" (replace "\<prefire>" with the name of the config file. If you have it in a folder then list out the whole path)
